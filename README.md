Derivative Calculator
---------------------

Methodology
===========

1. Converts user input to [PN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation)
2. Parses user input by + and - and performs differentiation, marking as necessary parts for chain rule.
3. Repeats and prints output. (Will likely need recursion for chain rule)

This is purely hypothetical at this point.
